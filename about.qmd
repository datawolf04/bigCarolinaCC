I'm just a Dad who likes data and cross country, and I'm happy my kids are running. I'm super excited for the fall and plan on sharing whatever results related to my boys running here. This is a way that I can engage with them about this sport that I love. 

All results for this site have been scraped from [MileSplit.com](https://nc.milesplit.com). I will be pointing back to the race sites to properly credit MileSplit and the schools who are using that resource to host their meet information.
